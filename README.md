High speed tanks multiplayer game in Unity using Mirror

This is just a quick and dirty project to learn how to make multiplayer games using Mirror in Unity.

It has a basic terrain generator but the scale of the tiles is 10x10x10 and there is rounding error, you can see where the tiles intersect. This should be fixed with tiles scaled to 1x1x1 I think.
